There is one animation on those slides, to see it you will need to access the presentation using a (simple) web server.
e.g.
- Start the server 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8081' (Python 2.7)
- Open in browser 'http://localhost:8081'

#### Code Samples
To access the code samples from the slides (or directly through the activator) go into the sources directory and use the command './activator ui'.
A browser window will open automatically.
